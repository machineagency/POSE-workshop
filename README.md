## Activities
We have 6 Jubilees for groups to use over the workshop. 3 are prepped for pipetting/liquid handling, and 3 for gel 3D printing applications.

### To use the machine:
- Login to the provided laptops with the same login/password used for WiFi access, if needed
- Open a terminal prompt and enter the following commands:
```
cd POSE-workshop
source .venv/bin/activate
jupyter lab
```
- This should open Jupyter lab on the machine! If it doesn't open automatically, copy & paste the url that pops up.
- If prompted, select the `POSE-workshop` kernel in Jupyter.
